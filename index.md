- [[BaCaDe](https://github.com/majsterklepka/BaCaDe "Aplikacja Bank Cash Deposit")]

## What I do?

Recently I wrote several programs. Here is one of them:

- [[Bank Cash Deposit](https://github.com/majsterklepka/blogtutor/tree/bank_rev_0.5 "Bank Cash Deposit rev. 0.5")] application for printing cash / money transfer forms.

Next is the program itself: 

- [[AppBankIncome](https://github.com/majsterklepka/blogtutor/tree/bank_rev_0.0.1 "AppBankIncome rev. 0.0.1")] This application, like the one above, is used to prepare printouts of cash deposit / bank transfer forms.

The common features of both programs are the leveling down of mistakes that most people commit. Both programs verify the bank account number in the IBAN standard and prepare a print that meets the requirements of most bank branches and deposit accepting points.

I limited to 59 (56) the number of characters in the field, I broke the IBAN number into segments, making it easier to enter, reducing the possibility of error.

The printout is legible, with large fonts.

Applications speak Polish and generate prints in Polish. They are in terminal character mode.

Both applications have been written under OS Linux. Tested under Fedora 26 Workstation Linux.

## Donation

If you want, you can give me a donation. This is not compulsory, but it is welcome. Software development is, however, a cost, often very significant for the budget.
