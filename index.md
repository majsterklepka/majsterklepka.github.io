# Welcome at My Homepage!

My name is Paweł Sobótka, I am the Engineer. I'm enthusiast open source too. I am 46 years old and I am a coder, but not just ... more at: [[INFO]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %} "informations")]

## My code repositories

- [[https://github.com/majsterklepka/bcd](https://github.com/majsterklepka/bcd "repository bcd")] (deprecated)
- [[https://github.com/majsterklepka/BaCaDe](https://github.com/majsterklepka/BaCaDe "repository BaCaDe")]

## What I do?

Recently I wrote several programs. Here is one of them:

- [[Bank Cash Deposit](https://github.com/majsterklepka/BaCaDe/releases/latest, "Latest release")] application for printing cash / money transfer forms.

Next is the program itself: 

- [[AppBankIncome](https://github.com/majsterklepka/bcd/tree/bank_rev_0.0.1 "AppBankIncome rev. 0.0.1")] This application, like the one above, is used to prepare printouts of cash deposit / bank transfer forms. (deprecated)

The common features of both programs are the leveling down of mistakes that most people commit. Both programs verify the bank account number in the IBAN standard and prepare a print that meets the requirements of most bank branches and deposit accepting points.

I limited to 59 (56) the number of characters in the field, I broke the IBAN number into segments, making it easier to enter, reducing the possibility of error.

The printout is legible, with large fonts.

Applications speak Polish and generate prints in Polish. They are in terminal character mode.

Both applications have been written under OS Linux. Tested under Fedora 26-27-28 Workstation Linux.
