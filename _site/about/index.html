<p>My name is Paweł Sobótka, I am 46 years old, I have completed university studies, I am an engineer &amp; scientist. Programming, like radio amateurs, is my passion and though, not always and everywhere, I can cherish and develop it is something that helps a lot in life. I used to play with a model … In the past time, I have interest in passion named Maker, that’s means, I’m a Maker. I don’t have a lots money, but I have a Dream… and I am Dreamer and somehow it worked out, I’m a visionary. For girl - I’m not married and I haven’t any children, but I don’t make research to find a Wife, I will remain a bachelor.</p>

<p>I really have a these name and vorname and  I’m really 46 and I’m an engineer. It does not matter to anyone, but for me … it is something important.</p>

<p>Probably someone will ask: What college? What department? I graduated from the field of technical physics, obtaining a discharge and defending a diploma thesis with a score of 4.0. He holds a Master of Science degree and I have specialized in nuclear physics. My profession is closely related to physics, I deal with, among others, opensurce electronics. I am a ham who uses only home made equipment for work (hobbies). And what is very important - my work is my hobby for me - and my profession is my passion.</p>

<p>With Linux I have been involved for some 15-17 years. I would have destroyed my hardware, because in those years Linux was considered a typical example of pirated software. Some people today think so. I used Aurox, Red Hat, Mandrive, Debian … I used and also use MS Windows, recently very rare .</p>

<p>I am writing in C, Python, PHP, HTML and CSS. I continue to learn and develop. I know a bit about computer graphics and DTP. I made my diploma work at Latex and my calculations were done with Octave.</p>
