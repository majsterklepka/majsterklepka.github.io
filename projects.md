### Package bcd

For many years ... I create. One of my projects is a bcd package written in Python.
The bcd package is a software package designed for use by home users / micro businesses. True, in the era of virtual bank accounts, its use may be negligible, but some is. I think so.

### Bank Cash Deposit (BaCaDe)

This project is written in C with fully use of GTK+ library. By now, it has full functionality and is compiling without any errors. For build I use meson build system, but most of work I do under Eclipse. More at repository wiki page.
