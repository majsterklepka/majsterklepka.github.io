# About

My name is Paweł Sobótka, I am 46 years old, I have completed university studies, I am an engineer & scientist. Programming, like radio amateurs, is my passion and though, not always and everywhere, I can cherish and develop it is something that helps a lot in life. I used to play with a model ... In the past time, I have interest in passion named Maker, that's means, I'm a Maker. I don't have a lots money, but I have a Dream... and I am Dreamer and somehow it worked out, I'm a visionary. For girl - I'm not married and I haven't any children, but I don't make research to find a Wife, I will remain a bachelor. 

I really have a these name and vorname and  I'm really 46 and I'm an engineer. It does not matter to anyone, but for me ... it is something important.

Probably someone will ask: What college? What department? I graduated from the field of technical physics, obtaining a discharge and defending a diploma thesis with a score of 4.0. He holds a Master of Science degree and I have specialized in nuclear physics. My profession is closely related to physics, I deal with, among others, opensurce electronics. I am a ham who uses only home made equipment for work (hobbies). And what is very important - my work is my hobby for me - and my profession is my passion.

With Linux I have been involved for some 15-17 years. I would have destroyed my hardware, because in those years Linux was considered a typical example of pirated software. Some people today think so. I used Aurox, Red Hat, Mandrive, Debian ... I used and also use MS Windows, recently very rare .

I am writing in C, Python, PHP, HTML and CSS. I continue to learn and develop. I know a bit about computer graphics and DTP. I made my diploma work at Latex and my calculations were done with Octave.
