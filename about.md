## About

[[home]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.md %} "main page")]

My name is Majster Klepka, I am 45 years old, I have completed university studies, I am an engineer. Programming, like radio amateurs, is my passion and though, not always and everywhere, I can cherish and develop it is something that helps a lot in life. I used to play with a model ...

I really have a different name and vorname, but I'm really 45 and I'm an engineer. It does not matter to anyone, but for me ... it is something important.

Probably someone will ask: What college? What department? I graduated from the field of technical physics, obtaining a discharge and defending a diploma thesis with a score of 4.0. He holds a Master of Science degree and I have specialized in nuclear physics.

With Linux I have been involved for some 15-17 years. I would have destroyed my hardware, because in those years Linux was considered a typical example of pirated software. Some people today think so. I used Aurox, Red Hat, Mandrive, Debian ... I used and also use MS Windows.

I am writing in C, Python, PHP, HTML and CSS. I continue to learn and develop. I know a bit about computer graphics and DTP. I made my diploma work at Latex and my calculations were done with Octave.
